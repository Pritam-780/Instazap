#  InstaZAP: 🎭 Real Instagram Breach Simulator

**⚠️DISCLAIMER:**  
This tool simulates an Instagram account breach by using advanced techniques and real-time actions.

This tool is **intended for ethical use only**—such as security education and penetration testing on devices you own.

## 📱Features
